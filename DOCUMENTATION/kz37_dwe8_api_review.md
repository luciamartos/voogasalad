*Part 1*

What about your API/design is intended to be flexible?

Our API is flexible because we have the ability to add different abilities and characteristics to multiple sprites.

How is your API/design encapsulating your implementation decisions?

The front end only has access to the back end through data that we provide it in a controller.

How is your part linked to other parts of the project?

The Game engine gives information to the front end, like position and image of the sprites.

What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your part and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)?

Exceptions that might occur would be if a win condition and a losing condition happened at the same time.
We would probably handle this by just causing the player to lose by default.

Why do you think your API/design is good (also define what your measure of good is)?

I think it's good that we have a sprite object with lots of different entities. That means its information is encapsulated and also separated from the classes that wish to modify the states. 

Part 2

What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on?

I'm most excited to work on physics because physics is cool.

What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on?

I'm most worried about collision checking because there are a lot of edge cases.

What is do you plan to implement this weekend?

I plan to implement the whole game engine this weekend. Personally, I plan to deal with physics and key inputs.

Discuss the use cases/issues created for your pieces: are they descriptive, appropriate, and reasonably sized?

The use cases are descriptive, appropriate, and reasonably sized.

Do you have use cases for errors that might occur?

We do have use cases for errors that might occur.
